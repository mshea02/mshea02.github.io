    <h1>Recipe: Herb Jam </h1>
    <h2>A tasty way to eliminate food waste!</h2>
    <p>A common wasteful practice in households across the country is the act of tossing the tops and stems of herbs and
        vegetables in the trash or compost. These gems are not only edible, but they are also loaded with flavor and
        nutrients!</p>
    <p>For instance; carrots, beets, radish, fennel tops, stems of cilantro, parsley, dill, and garlic scape can all
        come together in a beautiful medley of flavor when simmered in garlicky olive oil! Once cooled, blend them up
        and enjoy as a savory spread on bread or crackers. You can even add a dollop to a soup or stew, or swirl into
        hummus for a lively appetizer!</p>
    <p>Let's dive into the recipe!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 bunch carrot tops</li>

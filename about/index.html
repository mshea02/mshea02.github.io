        <h3>- More About Me -</h3>

        <p class="about-middle-text">"Throughout my life I have always had an interest in journalism, law, and writing. In my experiences, and through my course work at the University of Maryland, I have further developed my skills and enhanced my passion in these areas.</p>

        <p class="about-middle-text">As a sophomore Journalism Major at the Philip Merrill College of Journalism, I have continued to grow as a journalist and a reporter, learning the fundamentals from renowned professors, including former Pulitzer Prize winners. At Merrill I have been an active student and member of the community. Last year I worked as a Merrill Correspondent, meeting with prospective journalism students to speak about what the school has to offer, and answer key questions. I also was elected to the University Senate in which I am the only Undergraduate Journalism representative. In this position I represent hundreds of undergraduate journalism students as part of the largest and most influential governing body at the University Maryland. At Merrill I have also gained access to key writing opportunities such as Capitals Outsider, an independent blog revolving around the Washington Capitals hockey team. As a staff writer I have published many articles and I continue to expand my reporting and writing skills under the guidance of current members of The Washington Post.</p>

        <p class="about-middle-text">I also have a strong interest in law, and in addition to studying journalism I am Minoring in Law and Society. Through this minor I have been able to further develop legal reasoning and critical thinking skills, as well as prepare for law school. In classes for the minor I have been taught by professors that have been long active members of the law community. I have also had the chance to participate in legal discussions, construct legal research papers and conduct interviews with legal professionals. As I continue further with the minor, I will gain more knowledge, skills and experience within the realm of law, all of which will better prepare me for law school and a career in law. </p>

        <p class="about-middle-text">I have always been dedicated, hard-working, and eager to learn. These are traits that I have applied to the many roles I have filled in my life, and I will continue to apply them in every new experience and new challenge I face. Even in new situations, I am able to adapt and succeed because I am led by passion, dedication, and a hunger to do my very best. I am also driven and motivated to learn more and to seek out new opportunities, wherever they may be. My core values are truth, justice, and reliability. These values are built within me, and inspire me wherever life takes me."</p>

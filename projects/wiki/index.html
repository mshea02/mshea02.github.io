        <h3>Early Life</h3>
        <p>Wade was born the second of two children to JoLinda and Dwyane Wade Sr. in Chicago, Illinois, on January 17, 1982. Wade attributes the uncommon spelling of his and his father's first name to his grandmother.[6] JoLinda already had two children when she married Wade's father, and with him she had Dwyane and his older sister Tragil. The pair separated when Wade was four months old. Wade described his early childhood in the South Side of Chicago as trying.[7]</p>

        <h3>Gaining College Eligibility</h3>
        <p>Wade committed to Marquette University in Milwaukee, Wisconsin to play under coach Tom Crean. In his freshman year, Wade was sidelined by NCAA Proposition 48, which set academic eligibility requirements for participation in Division I sports. Effort and tutoring[15] sufficiently raised his academic standing so that he became eligible by the start of his sophomore year.[16]</p>

        <br>

        <h3>NBA Rookie Year</h3>
     <p>Selected fifth in the 2003 NBA draft by the Miami Heat, Wade became the highest ranked of only four Marquette first round draft picks.[23] Wade quickly emerged as a productive player, averaging 16.2 points on 46.5% shooting as well as 4 rebounds and 4.5 assists.[24] After a 5–15 start, the Heat gradually improved to finish 42–40 and qualify for the playoffs.[25] Wade served up outstanding postseason performances, particularly against the Indiana Pacers during the Eastern Conference Semifinals.[23] Wade earned a unanimous selection to the 2004 NBA All-Rookie Team[23] and finished third in Rookie of the Year voting (after LeBron James and Carmelo Anthony).[23] He placed among the top five rookies in several statistical categories, including second in field goal percentage, second in steals, third in scoring, fourth in assists, and fourth in minutes played.[23]</P>

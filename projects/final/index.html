            <p><b class="intro">THE PAST DECADE OF MUSIC</b> has undoubtedly gifted us with many memorable hits. Whether you’re jamming to Taylor Swift on a long car ride, trying to learn the lyrics to the latest Drake song, or maybe you’re more of a Bruno Mars fan, undeniably  the most popular songs have left us dancing, or as some would say, “vibing.”
            </p>
            <p> But when it comes to the music we listen to, what are we really injecting into our ears? What are the most popular songs actually about, and what does it say about our society?</p>
            <p>Many could speculate on what the overarching themes of songs tend to be about. But what if we had a more concrete way of knowing the data? Even more so, how well does it align with the public perceptions of what music tends to be about?</p>
            <p>“There are definitely strong beliefs about what music is typically about. I know many could guess but it would be interesting to see how accurate what people say really is,” said Chase Rowland, a college student who has grown up predominantly listening to music within the past decade.</p>

        <section>
            <p>To find out the answer, we collected data by consulting a trusted and valued source for music rankings: Billboard.</p>
            <p>While many have heard of the “Billboard Hot-100”, the music industry standard record chart published weekly, Billboard takes it a step further and releases a “Year-End Chart” for songs each year consisting of the most popular songs from that year, ranked.</p>
            <p>In our research, we decided to take the <b>top-15</b> songs of those rankings for the years 2012-2021, for a total of 150 of the most popular songs of the last decade. After taking those songs, we then created categories based on different overarching themes.
            </p>
            <p>There was a total of <b>16</b> groups created. While certain songs may apply to more than one category, we grouped by the category that contained the main (or overarching) theme of the song, so that we could get a more general and accurate sense of the data.</p>

        <section>
            <p>From the onset, we started by providing descriptions of each group in order to better sort the songs, and to avoid data that would be useless, for instance many songs being grouped into a large category. By splitting these up, we were able to more accurately define what the themes of popular songs truly tended to be about.</p>
            <p>For example, instead of a large category about love that would likely reveal very little, we split it up into three groups: “Relationships, Love/Feelings and Sex/physical intimacy”. </p>
            <p>The act of deciphering song meanings, and placing them into groups was long and tedious. There are many interpretations of what songs could be about, but the data revealed that the most popular songs of the past decade tended to revolve around four main categories: Relationships (<b>30%</b>), Personal story/moral or lesson (<b>22%</b>), Love/Feelings (<b>14%</b>) and Sex/physical intimacy (<b>11%</b>).</p>

        <section>
            <p>“I was not entirely surprised by what the data showed. I feel like many of the most popular songs are based around love and romance which is why I would expect those percentages to be high,” said Sarah Cassuto, another college student who is most familiar with music of the past decade. “I am surprised at one aspect. I did not expect the number of songs about a personal experience or lessons to be that high. It shows that there’s more songs dedicated to that topic than young music listeners may think.”</p>
            <p>While many could have predicted that a majority of the songs would be about topics of love, there were still a lot of interesting findings in the data: Besides the large percentage of songs about a personal story or lesson, there are other honorable mentions that came up more than one might think.</p>
            <p>For instance, <b>6%</b> of the most popular songs fell under the category “Self-praise” meaning that the song consists of the artist “lifting” themselves up.</p>
            <p>Additionally, <b>4%</b> of songs were about money, wealth, or buying things. Also, while many songs talked about drugs or alcohol,  only about <b>1%</b> of the most popular songs actually had that topic as their central overarching theme.</p>
            <p>But how well does the data match preconceived beliefs among young people about music topics? To find out, we surveyed young respondents on social media asking them to choose a category, of the <b>16</b> we constructed, that they believed represented the most common theme for popular songs between <b>2012-2021</b>.</p>
            <p>The data suggests that beliefs about music did in fact match the data relatively well. The most popular answer among survey respondents was “Love/Feelings” (<b>37%</b>) which according to the data was the third most popular song theme.</p>
            <p>Additionally, the top theme found in the data, “Relationships”, received the second most selections among survey respondents with <b>25%</b>. This shows that many songs are in fact about love and relationships as most people would assume.</p>

        <section>
            <p>But despite these similarities, there was one key difference. The third most popular selection among survey respondents was “Drugs/Alcohol” with <b>17%</b>. The real data, as previously mentioned, showed that when it comes to the actual main theme of the song, not just whether it is referenced, that most song themes are actually not focused on drugs and alcohol. This may have been misleading for young people as many songs do in fact reference drugs or alcohol, but again that does not mean it is the theme or what the artist is trying to focus on.</p>
            <p>“I think drugs and alcohol are mentioned a lot in music, and are pretty prevalent in society, so I’m not surprised that many people would answer that way. It is interesting that when you look at the data and the actual themes, it is perhaps less overarching than some might think,” said Rowland.</p>
            <p>So, what does this say about society? Well to start, love songs are undeniably the most popular in the music industry.</p>
            <p>But it also reveals that young people might fail to see the bigger picture in many songs. The data showed that a majority of songs were about a personal story or lesson that the artist was trying to convey, but only <b>2%</b> of respondents chose that theme as their answer choice, putting themes such as drugs and alcohol down at overwhelmingly higher rates.  </p>
            <p>Additionally, only <b>5%</b> of respondents answered that “Sex/physical intimacy” was a main theme when according to the data, it showed up as the central topic in <b>11%</b> of songs, much more than drugs and alcohol.</p>
            <p>At the end of the day, no matter what music you like, it will be interesting to see how the songs of the next decade match this data, and if they will continue to revolve around these central themes. Next time you fall in love with a song, try to take a deeper look at the lyrics. You may be interested in your findings.</p>
